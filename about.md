# Instrdution to Artificial intelligence (AI)
Intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems, as opposed to the natural intelligence of living beings.

**Milestones / History**
- Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field (1936-2012)
- Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956
- Many years of ups and downs with cycles of optimism and funding. (Read about AI winter and the different cycles)
- 1990's Expert systems - now more broadly replaced by Machine learning and Neural Networks
- Deep learning boom after 2012 surpassing all previous AI techniques
- In 2017 transformer architecture has led to todays boom and hype

# Sub fields / Disciplines

## Machine Learning (ML)
Focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning includes subfields like:

- **Supervised learning** - requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties:
    - Classification - where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in
    - Regression - where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input

- **Unsupervised learning** - analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.

- **Reinforcement learning** - learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good". 

- **Transfer learning** - is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.

- **Deep Learning** - A subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers. 

    It's particularly powerful for tasks like:
    - Image recognition
    - Natural language processing - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Concerns creating algorithms that allow computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    - Pattern recognition

## Robotics
Integrates AI algorithms into physical devices, allowing them to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics applies AI in fields like manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration.

## Computer Vision
Involves teaching computers to interpret and understand the visual world. This discipline enables applications like facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.

## Cognitive Computing
Aims to simulate human thought processes in a computerized model, combining AI with cognitive science to create systems that mimic human reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

## Neuroscience and AI
Studies the human brain to inspire the development of AI systems. This includes understanding how neural networks in the brain process information to improve artificial neural networks.

## Other
Besides this there is a mix of philosophy AI hybrid disciplines. Also, some parts of Big Data and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can be attributed as AI.


# GPT djungle
The building blocks of a GPT and specificaly Chat GPT is a bit of a djungle.
