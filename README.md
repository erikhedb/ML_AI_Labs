# ML_AI_Labs
This is a collection of my own private notes on the topic of ML and AI. Nothing unique but rather my own personal repository of learnings.

## Install and usage

-	Python 3.11.8 (Version used for these labs)
-	venv
-	jupyter jupyterlab

```
> python3 -m vevn env
> source bin/activate
> python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
> jupyter lab
```

# ML Labs
- Lab 0 - Some background to datasets and visualization
- Wisconsin breast cancer data set - Into a Pandas Data Frame - Scrible notebook

**Supervised learning**
- Lab 1 - KNN - Applications in both classification and regression
- Lab 2 - Linerar Regresson - Multi dimensional f(X)=kX+b
- Lab 3 - Logistic Regression - Binary Classification - Medical, Finance, Marketing etc
- Lab 4 - Decision Trees - Customer Segmentation, Loan Approval, Medicine, Email Filtering etc
- Lab 5 - Random Forests - Creates a multitude of decision trees during training time
- Lab 6 - NaiveBayes - NaiveBayes Classification of text, sentiment analysis and medical diagnosis
- Lab 8 - Perceptron - Model of a sigle neuron - Binary Classificaton with linear data 
- Lab 9 - SVM - Suport Vector Machine - Both for classification and regression tasks - Image, text etc

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Lab 7 - PCA - Principal Component Analysis - linear method and might not perform well with polynomialy structured data
- Lab 10 - KMeans - Unsupervised learning used for clustering

# TODO

## Explore SDV ML Algorithms
- Synthetic Data Vault - Used in TDM for Test data purposes
- Explor the different algorithms used and map them onto the ML landscape

## Explore the Wisconsin breast cancer data set -  [From scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- Does multiple linear regresion say anything?
- What are the most important factors for breast cancer?

- Read up on the conclutions for different classifyer algorithms
- Run and compare the result
