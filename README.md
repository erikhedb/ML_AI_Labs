# TODO

## Explore SDV ML Algorithms
- Synthetic Data Vault - Used in TDM for Test data purposes
- Explor the different algorithms used and map them onto the ML landscape

## Explore the Wisconsin breast cancer data set -  [From scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- Does multiple linear regresion say anything?
- What are the most important factors for breast cancer?

- Read up on the conclutions for different classifyer algorithms
- Run and compare the result
